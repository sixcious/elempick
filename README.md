## About
ElemPick is a simple element picker that can generate a path to an HTML element on the page without requiring any permissions from you. Click on the toolbar icon, then click on the element you want on the page, and then click the Clipboard Button above the path in the small UI Window to copy it.

## Features
- Generates a CSS Selector or XPath Expression for an element on the page
- Can also generate JS Paths (JavaScript Paths)
- Dual algorithm support: Use ElemPick's internal algorithm or Chromium's
- Context Menu Option available so ElemPick can be one right click away
- DOM Traversal Buttons to allow you to navigate to a nearby element
- Limited support for elements inside Shadow DOM and Same-Origin Iframes
- Options: Optimize paths and choose your preferred quote style
- User Interface: A simple UI made with Material Design and Lit

## FAQ

#### What is the minimum browser version (and why is it to so high)?
The current minimum browser version is Chrome/Edge/Firefox `128`. I usually update the minimum browser version every time I do a release so I can use the latest and greatest ECMAScript features without worry. If your browser doesn't support it, I'm afraid you'll have to use another app/extension (sorry!).

#### Why is the production version's source code minified?
I use [Terser](https://github.com/terser/terser) to minify the source code for production releases that I upload to your browser's web store. I mainly do this because I write a lot of comments and `console.log()` statements for debugging and because it cuts down the file size significantly.

#### Where's the source code?
Because it's still very new, ElemPick is currently proprietary. I may make it open source in the future, though (I thank you for your understanding).
